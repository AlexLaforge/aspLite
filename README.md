# ASP-VBScript-Framework

This framework can help to develop better ASP/VBScript applications. Check it out.

Install as a website or virtual directory in IIS.

Preview: https://aspfw.quickersite.com

Highlights:
* split html/css/javascript and asp
* conditionally load asp files (rather than include them 'all')
* charset utf-8 is used
* .net-alike codebehind approach
* light-weight and fast scripts

This ASP/VBScript framework does not include frontend CSS/JavaScript libraries. But just for the fun of it, 
I added a Bootstrap sample.
