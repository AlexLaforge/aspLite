# ASP-VBScript-Framework

This framework can help to develop better ASP/VBScript applications. 

Install as a website or virtual directory in IIS.

Preview: https://aspfw.quickersite.com

Highlights:
* split html/css/javascript and asp
* conditionally load asp files (rather than include them 'all')
* charset utf-8
* .net-alike codebehind approach
* light-weight and fast ASP class
* write your own plugins

This ASP/VBScript framework does not include or favorize frontend CSS/JavaScript libraries. But just for the fun of it, 
I added a Bootstrap sample and some AJAX examples each using jQuery. 

## Roadmap

* make file (and complete folder?) uploads in ASP classic easier
* wrap server-side xml requests in a reusable class
* keep security high (protect against sqli, csrf, brute force attacks, cookie theft, etc)
* implement one or more WYSIWYG editors (as plugins)
* facilitate multilingual websites and applications
* find a way to deal with some common file types: jpg, pdf, zip (create, resize, stream, etc)
